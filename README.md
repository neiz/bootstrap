[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)
=================


This is a custom compile of Twitter's Bootstrap.  This is a great framework, however, a lot of the base CSS is invasive.  This version has all of the HTML element overrides removed.  Only classes which correlate with non-invasive bootstrap functionality are left.

All of the classes from the "Components" and "Javascript" section are intact and usable just as the documentation states.
